Blogging has been in my mind for a long time. Not that, I want to post daily about what I have done in my normal life, but because I wanted to organize the notes and findings that I am having in my work/learning time.

As I was looking for better options, I came across jekyll, which works well with github pages for creating my own blog (a static one), thus publishing this, let's hope I won't discontinue this hobby, as I really want to make it one.

If you want to learn about jekyll/get a basic idea, check these resources, as I found them helpful:
